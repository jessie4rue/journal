# Why I Want to Learn to Code
I was learning HTML and CSS in junior high. It wasn't anything serious. I liked playing around with different tags and stylings. I enjoy seeing how it translated from my text editor to the browser.
When I was in high school, my family decided to start unschooling, which for me as a sophmore, meant spending way too much time in front of a computer "learning", but eventually I got bored browsing and decided to learn a little bit more coding. I joined codecademy and soon found myself writing way more than headings and paragraphs into my page structures.
