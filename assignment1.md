# Why I Want to Learn to Code
I want to learn to code because it is rewarding to see how text translates to colors, images, and even animations. The feeling of control I have over every aspect of the layout and visuals of a site is stunning. A webpage is a playground that I control every aspect of.
My original motivaton for learning HTML was to understand what makes up a website, but before I knew it I had fallen in love with it. I want to learn even more web languages so that I can build more complex websites and maybe make a little bit of money in the process.
I have wanted to make coding more than a hobby for a while, probably since about 10th grade. I didn't know where to get started. I eventually went out to San Francisco, California, only to return to my hometown defeated. The program I was a part of promised participants a future in their career field of choice, but didn't give the support needed for those who didn't want to start a company of their own.
Coming back to South Dakota was not a death sentence for my ambition that many thought it would be. Instead, it gives me the means to continue doing what I love.
